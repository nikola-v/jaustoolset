   <description xml:space="preserve">
      Tests: Add a warning to this effect – “If the trigger of an added transition is an internal event that causes a state change 
      in the base services, care must be taken to ensure that the internal event is first initialized by another transition that is 
      triggered by a newly defined input message. That is, the new internal event must be causally and temporally related 
      to a new input message such that the internal event executes only after a transition to the related input message has 
      been executed at least once.
      (This is the base service and TransitionTest8 is the derived service that specifies the internal event and associated transition)
