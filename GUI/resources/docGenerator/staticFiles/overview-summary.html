 	<h1> JAUS Service Definition Set Overview </h1>
</center>

<p>
  Services and service oriented architectures (SOAs) are widely used in the IT domain. The core principle of SOAs is the design of systems by means of 
  distributed capabilities that are self contained, loosely coupled, and have well defined interfaces. A service is a unit of work done by a service 
  provider to achieve desired end results for a service consumer. Both provider and consumer are roles played by software agents on behalf of their 
  owners. This principle fits very well in the unmanned systems domain.  The JAUS Service Interface Definition Language (JSIDL) is a top-level 
  specification that defines a language for describing unmanned system capabilities.  It uses the Relax NG Compact [rng] syntax as a means to formally 
  specify a schema that is to be used to create JAUS Service Definitions (JSDs) for all defined capabilities.  Each JSD must be written in XML and must 
  be validated against the JSIDL schema.  The machine readable schema permits the development and use of automated tools, and consequently reduces 
  integration time and provides for technology insertion.

<!-- description of each element of service definition -->
<h3> <a name="description"> Description </a> </h3>
<p>
A required element that must be used to provide a brief textual description of the service and its functionality. 
The description element has an attribute called xml:space. Basic textual formatting can be preserved in the description 
element if the value of this attribute is set to �preserve�.  
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="assumptions"> Assumptions </a> </h3>
<p>
A required element that must be used to provide a brief textual description about the assumptions made about the nature 
of the communication channels the service uses to communicate with its clients.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
 
<h3> <a name="references"> References </a> </h3>
<p>
An optional element that can be used to provide a list of service definitions that the service references
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="declared_constant_set"> Declared Constant Set </a> </h3>
<p>
An optional element that can be used to define a reusable set of constant definitions.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="declared_type_set"> Declared Type Set </a> </h3>
<p>
An optional element that can be used to define a reusable set of data type definitions.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="message_set"> Message Set </a> </h3>
<p>
A required element that must be used to define the input and output message sets that make
up the external vocabulary of the service. When a service definition references other service 
definitions, the vocabulary of the service is determined by the nature of the reference used. 
Each message definition within the message_set contains a detailed encoding of the structure 
of the message data.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="internal_events_set"> Internal Events Set </a> </h3>
<p>
The internal events set is used to define events  like timouts that occur internal to a service 
and have a direct effect on the protocol behavior of the service. Like message definitions, event 
definitions can contain a detailed specification of the encoding of data that may be associated 
with the event.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3> <a name="protocol_behavior"> Protocol Behavior </a> </h3>
<p>
The protocol or message exchange behavior of a service is defined in the form of a finite state 
machine. The definition of a service is structured around the separation of the behavior that is 
related to the exchange of messages (protocol)  and the application behavior application behavior. 
The behavior specified by the service definition is that of the protocol and not the application. 
For example, the behavior element of a waypoint driver service definition must describe only the 
message interchange behavior between the service and its clients. It should not specify the internal 
computation required to say, generate wrench commands used to reach a given waypoint.
