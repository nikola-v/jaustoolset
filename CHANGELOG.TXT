Version 2.0 is a significant update from v1.5.  There are several other significant feature additions.  Please consult the User's Guide for additional details.

- The Code Generator has been updated to generate separate libraries for each service in an inherited chain.  This allows a single component to support multiple services while still inheriting from a common parent as per the JAUS Core Service Set (AS5710, Version 1).  This will also promote better code re-use.

- JTS functionality is now encapsulated in an Eclipse Plug-in.   

- Support for Promela-based protocol validation has been added.

- Fixed issues related to validation of messages and protocol behavior

- Added support for generating Microsoft Visual Studio build files in addition to Scons (C++ only).



Known issues:

- Generated C# code will not compile if the target directory contains the phrase "src" 
- Import of JSIDL+ files is not supported (this does not impact published SAE JAUS services)
- Generated Promela files cannot be modified or deleted until JTS is closed.
- The Eclipse Plugin does not currently support FramedHTML document generation.
