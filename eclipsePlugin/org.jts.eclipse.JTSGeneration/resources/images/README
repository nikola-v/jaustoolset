For each model class you define, place here two corresponding
icons representing that type.  The image file format can be
either gif, jpg, or png.

File naming convention is as the following example illustrates:

  e.g.:  class:  Person

   image file:  Person16.gif
                Person32.gif

Again, the file format can be something other than gif (jpg or png).

Small and large image file names are the class name concatenated 
with '16' and '32' respectively.  These images should be 16x16
and 32x32 pixels in size.

You can also specify icons for plural versions of a type (used
in type and list views).  e.g.:  Persons32.png

Different icons can be specified for each state an object is
in.  See the IssueMgr demo application for an example.
See the JMatter manual for complete instructions.

2. you may place in this directory a file App32.png that will be
  used as the icon identifying the main application frame.

3. Finally, place a splash.gif (or jpg or png) in this directory
  if you want a splash screen image.
